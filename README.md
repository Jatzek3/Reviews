# Reviews

This is the code for my website written in Django on my own. The code isnt transcribed from any source.

https://learn-python-programming.herokuapp.com/

In developing the backend i used the sources and knowledge from which i was learning before, but it was only chunks of code. I often seeked help on stackoverflow which in many occasions proved to be very helpfull.

### Structure

Website consists of four main apps:
- Homepage
- Tutorials
- Exercises
- Books

### Backend functionalities
- Signup
- Log in and Log out
- Base.html
- Links for each app
- List View
- Detail View
- Custom User
